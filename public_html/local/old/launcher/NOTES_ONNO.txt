GENERAL fLOW

* Mod launcher puts most data in "buffer" DB, which acts as a storage for meta 
  data. Each request for a new Moodle client is stored in buffer DB.

* Cron job starts with external/usr/local/scripts/jeelo_processor/client.php,
  which executes client::run. This script makes a request to the mother server
  to send back data from the buffer DB.

  The response is processed as a csv file, where each line contains the 
  information for exactly one Moodle client installation.

  Depending on the status as reported by the similarly named field in the csv 
  line, either client::process_new_client or client::process_update_client is
  called.

  The static function client::process_update_client instantiates class 
  client_updater and calls client_updater#start_updater.
