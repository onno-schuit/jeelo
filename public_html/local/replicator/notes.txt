See test.php for standard Moodle delete functions (courses, categories)

TODO: 

1. Create test for upgrading moodle code base: does public_html/admin work 
   without logging in? We need this for installing new modules or Moodle upgrades.

   /usr/bin/php maintenance.php --enable
   /usr/bin/php upgrade.php --non-interactive --allow-unstable
   /usr/bin/php maintenance.php --disable


2. What metadata do we need?
    - categories to replicate
    - courses within category to multiply
    - users

3. Establish priorities:
    - Start from scratch with Moodle 2 install
    - Get basics working:
        I   Replicate code base
        II  Replicate database
        III Delete irrelevant courses on child moodle
        IV  Backup relevant course
        V   Multiply courses for each class / group
    - Get existing interface working
